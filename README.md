Open the GitHub Pages link and type in any song or artist. The app uses iTunes public api as it doesn't require api keys and it's free. It returns the first 20 results it gets from iTunes and populates them in a results div as a list of cards containing the cover, the artist, and the album. It also contains a 30-second snippet of the song that can be played, much like the Spotify Embed.
